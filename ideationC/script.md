Ideation Workshop Script: Organizing Local Olympic Games
Main Objective
To collaboratively generate innovative ideas that empower sports fans to organize local Olympic Games between two international editions.
Ice Breaker: "Local Olympics Trivia"
Duration: 10 minutes
Instructions:
Each participant shares a fun fact or personal experience related to the Olympics or local sports events.
This activity helps participants connect and sets a positive tone for the workshop.
Main Steps of the Ideation Process
Step 1: Introduce the Problem Statement
Duration: 10 minutes
Instructions:
C (the leader) presents the problem statement: “How might we help sports fans organize local Olympic Games in between two international editions?”
Allow participants to ask clarifying questions to ensure everyone understands the challenge.
Step 2: Mind Mapping
Duration: 20 minutes
Instructions:
Participants will create a mind map on a whiteboard or digital tool.
Start with the central idea (organizing local Olympic Games) and branch out with sub-ideas, themes, and related concepts.
Encourage free association and creativity; no idea is too far-fetched.
Step 3: Idea Development in Small Groups
Duration: 30 minutes
Instructions:
Divide participants into small groups (2-4 people).
Each group selects one or two branches from the mind map to develop into concrete ideas.
Groups should consider aspects like logistics, community engagement, funding, and sustainability.
Prepare a brief presentation (2-3 minutes) for their developed ideas.
Step 4: Present Developed Ideas
Duration: 30 minutes
Instructions:
Each group presents their developed ideas to the larger group.
After each presentation, allow for a brief Q&A session to clarify and discuss the ideas further.
Step 5: Idea Prioritization Using "Impact vs. Effort" Matrix
Duration: 20 minutes
Instructions:
Participants will use an "Impact vs. Effort" matrix to evaluate each idea.
Draw a large grid on a whiteboard or digital tool with four quadrants:
High Impact, Low Effort
High Impact, High Effort
Low Impact, Low Effort
Low Impact, High Effort
Each participant places sticky notes representing their ideas in the appropriate quadrant based on perceived impact and effort required.
Step 6: Voting Process
Duration: 15 minutes
Instructions:
Each participant receives three votes (using stickers or dots) to allocate to their favorite ideas from the "High Impact" quadrants.
Participants can distribute their votes among different ideas or concentrate them on one idea they believe is most impactful.
Step 7: Selection of Main Idea
Duration: 10 minutes
Instructions:
Tally the votes and identify the idea with the most votes as the main idea to pursue further.
