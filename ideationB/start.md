Each participant will write down as many ideas as possible in a set time frame (15 minutes) using sticky notes or a digital tool.

**Step 4: Idea Refinement**

**Duration:** 20 minutes
**Instructions:**
In small groups (2-3 participants), choose one idea from each category to refine.
Consider feasibility, impact, and how it aligns with the objective.
Prepare a brief presentation (2-3 minutes) for each refined idea.

**Step 5: Present Refined Ideas.**

**Duration:** 30 minutes
**Instructions:**
Each small group presents their refined idea to the larger group.
After each presentation, allow for a brief Q&A session to clarify and discuss the ideas further.

**Step 6: Voting Process**
